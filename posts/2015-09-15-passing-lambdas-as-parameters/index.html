<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>At <a href="https://shopify.com">my current job</a>, I have been working on merchants stores&rsquo; integration with third parties. As a part of this task, I found that I needed to ensure that our app batches API calls to the third party. After doing a quick measurement, I found that batching API calls lowered the processing time by about 2x-5x when compared to doing the same calls in sequential order. However, whereas sequential processing had a clear approach of dealing with successful and failed calls, the batch call had none of that.</p>

<h2 id="lambdas">Lambdas</h2>

<p>The answer was suggested by my team lead and clarified by a co-worker. I then remembered I knew this about Ruby and I&rsquo;ve been using a similar approach extensively when writing Clojure programs.</p>

<p>Much like JS, Ruby allows us to pass a <code>lambda</code> or a <code>Proc</code> into a method as a parameter. We can then call this stored function with certain parameters. In the case above, what I wanted was to partition the responses to batched API calls into successful and failed ones. I could then invoke 2 lambdas, one for each set of responses and do the appropriate thing.</p>

<h2 id="a-trivial-example">A trivial example</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to share the code specific to my problem, so here&rsquo;s a trivialized version of the same approach:</p>
